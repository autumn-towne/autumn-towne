## Hi there 🙋‍♀️

My name is Autumn, and I'm an M.S. candidate in Data Science, Analytics, and Engineering at Arizona State University. I've earned a minor in Global Health and certificate in Geographic Information Systems. My work so far has explored topics like neural network-based pneumonia detection, energy infrastructure in Maricopa County, and food insecurity stigma. I’ve led a student hackathon focused on satellite data-based solutions for sustainability, collaborated with researchers in Guatemala, and built skills in tools like Python, SQL, and R. I’m motivated by questions that sit at the intersection of data, equity, and environment, and I’m looking to grow in roles where I can contribute thoughtfully and keep learning.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: autonomous systems trajectory prediction
- ✅ My strongest skills: Python, R, SQL, ArcGIS, Alteryx, Tableau, CNNs
- 🧠 Previous research areas: transportation, global health, infrastructure, image classification

- 💬 Ask me about: food insecurity stigma in Guatemala (I spent 6 weeks interviewing people there!)
- 🌱 Currently learning about: biostatistics, autonomous vehicle engineering
- 📫 How to reach me: autumnlotustowne@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I used to do competitive Irish dance!
